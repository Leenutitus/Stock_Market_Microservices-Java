# Alpaca Buy Microservice

This is a Java application that serves as the foundation for an Alpaca buy microservice. The microservice retrieves stock information from Alpaca Paper Trading using the Alpaca API and allows you to place buy orders for specific stocks.

## Overview

The Alpaca Buy Microservice is a simple Java console application that interacts with Alpaca's Paper Trading API. It allows users to retrieve stock information and place buy orders for specific stocks. It is an essential component for building a trading application or automated trading system..

## Prerequisites
Before using the Alpaca Buy Microservice, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Alpaca API Keys**: You need to obtain your Alpaca API Key ID and Secret Key. You can sign up for an account and obtain API keys from the Alpaca website.

2. **Java Development Environment**: Make sure you have a Java development environment set up on your system.

3. **Apache Maven**: This application uses Apache Maven for dependency management. Install Maven if not already installed.

## Configuration
Open the `alpacabuy` class and replace the placeholder values with your Alpaca API Key ID and Secret Key:

```java
private static final String ALPACA_API_KEY = "YOUR_ALPACA_API_KEY";
private static final String ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_ALPACA_SECRET_KEY";
```

You can also change the `ALPACA_BASE_URL` to use the live trading API instead of the paper trading API:

```java
private static final String ALPACA_BASE_URL = "https://api.alpaca.markets"; // Use this for live trading
```

## Usage
1. **Build the Application**:
   Compile the application using Apache Maven:

   ```shell
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the application using the following command:

   ```shell
   java -cp target/alpacabuy-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar alpacabuy.alpacabuy
   ```

4. **Application Workflow**:

1. The application will retrieve stock information and display it, including the stock name and status.

2. Enter the quantity you want to buy.

3. The application will place a market buy order for the specified stock with the provided quantity.

4. The buy order will be confirmed, and the application will display a success message.

5. You can enter "EXIT" at any time to exit the application.

## Code Structure
The Alpaca Buy Microservice consists of the following key components:

- `alpacabuy` class: The main class that handles API requests, stock retrieval, and order placement.
- `retrieveStockInfo` method: Retrieves stock information using the Alpaca API.
- `placeBuyOrder` method: Places a buy order for a specific stock and quantity.
-  Configuration variables for API keys and base URL.
-  Main application loop for user interaction.

## Error Handling
The application handles errors and exceptions by displaying informative error messages. If any issues occur during API requests or order placement, an error message will be shown to the user.

## Functionality

1. Retrieve Stock Information
The retrieveStockInfo function allows you to retrieve information about a specific stock using its symbol. The retrieved data includes the stock's name and status.

2. Place Buy Orders
The placeBuyOrder function allows you to place buy orders for a specific stock and quantity. By default, it places market orders that remain "Good 'til Cancel" (GTC).

## Example
Here's an example of how to use the Alpaca Buy Microservice:

Enter a stock symbol, e.g., "AAPL."
You will receive information about the stock.
Enter the quantity of the stock you want to buy.
A buy order will be placed, and you will receive a confirmation message.

## Important Notes

- This code is for educational purposes and is set up for paper trading on Alpaca. If you intend to use it for live trading, change the `ALPACA_BASE_URL` to use the live trading URL instead.

- Error handling: The code has basic error handling, but for production use, you should implement more robust error handling and logging.

- Ensure that you comply with Alpaca's terms of service and follow best practices for trading and investment.
